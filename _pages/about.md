I am a pension-consultant-turned-academic with an interest in all things retirement. 

I spent 8 years assisting private and public sector clients in Canada with all aspects of pension plan design, funding and management. I am a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries and the Canadian Institute of Actuaries. In 2010 I joined Simon Fraser University in a tenure-track position to teach and to conduct practical pension research. 

My research is heavily influenced by my background in industry, exploring emerging issues in pension practice through both qualitative and quantitative lenses. Inspired by successful collaborations between pension practitioners and academics abroad, my goal is to build connections between universities and the pension industry both domestically and internationally, and to increase Canadian research capacity in pensions. I continue to be actively involved within the actuarial community and received the Canadian Institue of Actuaries' Bronze Volunteer Award in 2017 for my service to the actuarial profession.
